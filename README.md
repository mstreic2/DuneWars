A project from my CS3500 Software Practice 1 class.
University of Utah Fall 2021
By Matt Streicher and Jim Morgan

This class was quite a challenge. Not only was this my first semester at the University of Utah, but also my first introduction to C# and working
on a larger scale projects. I also faced some interesting challenges outside the classroom such as almost becoming homeless in the middle of the 
semester, and also working at the same time. Thankfully, this didn't disrupt me and Jim's ability to equally contribute and complete this project.
I learned a lot from this class and my partner as well. I am very proud of this project and the way it turned out.
